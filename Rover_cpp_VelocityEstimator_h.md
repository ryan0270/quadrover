This class uses the features points found by FeatureFinder to estimate the velocity. The algorithm itself is my creation, and probabilistically fuses the state estimate from the translation state Kalman Filter with the feature points in the current and previous images to create the "best" (maximum a posteriori) estimate of the velocity. The paper describing the algorithm is still in the review process, but after its published I'll add it here.
